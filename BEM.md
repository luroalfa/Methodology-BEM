# METODOLOGIA BEM

## Description BEM
> The BEM methodology helps us divide the user interface into independent blocks.
> This helps us create scalable and reusable components.
**Block**
**Element**
**Modifier**


## Block
### For example:
> **.main** (This is a block)

> It is any autonomous and isolated element of our document.
It can be a menu, a gallery, a form and a browser etc.

## Element
### For example:
> **.main__item** (This is a element using __)

>It is each of the elements of the block.
It can be a link, a photo, a text field etc.

## Modifier
### For example:
> **.main--footer** (This is a modifier using --)

>When a block exists elsewhere on our website but with a modification. 
It can be the text color, font size, alignment etc.
